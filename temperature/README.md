# Temperature is an inference parameter that influences the variability of the responses generated by a foundation model

In this lab, we will demonstrate how setting the temperature affects the model's response. You can think of temperature as a way to control the creativity & variability of the model. A temperature of 0 means no variability - the current version\* of the model will return a consistent response to the same prompt. The higher the temperature, the more variation in responses can be expected. In creative scenarios like content creation, a higher temperature can be helpful. In business process scenarios & code generation, a temperature of zero may be best.

- If the model gets updated, you will likely see a change in responses from the previous version of the model. It's always safest to assume variability in responses over time, even when the temperature is zero.

You can build the application code by copying the code snippets below and pasting into the indicated Python file.
